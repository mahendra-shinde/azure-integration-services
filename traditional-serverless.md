| Traditional | Serverless |
|-------------|------------|
| Initialize the Physical Server | Build the serverless App and Deploy |
| Initialize VMs / Platform | Deploy to a Managed Storage |
| Deploy your Workload: in few seconds, workload is ready to serve end users | Only on "Trigger" your workload would be deployed on platform, finish execution and then QUIT! |
| Your workload is ON server even when not processing any request! | Your workload is INSIDE managed storage and does not use SERVER compute when IDLE. |
| Regular Workload (Apps, Databases) | Smaller unit of work (LogicApp, Functions) |
